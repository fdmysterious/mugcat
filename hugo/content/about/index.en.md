My name is Florian Dupeyron. I am currently 26 years old and work as an
embedded software engineer at the Parisian branch of [ELSYS
Design](https://elsys-design.com).

Being passionate about computer science and electronics, it is important to me
to work at the interface between the physical and digital worlds on demanding
projects, while continuously improving my skills to perfect my craftsmanship.

I am also a musician. I have been playing the piano since I was 5 years old,
and since September 2022, I have been learning to play the organ.

# Roadmap

## Embedded SW Engineer - ELSYS Design

**09/2021 - ?**

My mission is to work with major clients in the development and maintenance of
complex embedded software on various embedded targets.

Since September 2022, I have been promoted to the
design office of the of the ÃŽle-de-France center. This new position not only involves
meeting client needs but also developing my expertise to supervise engineers on
various projects and improving the technical tools used by the company.


### Acquired skills:

- *Bare-metal development*:  Bare-metal development on various targets (STM32, MC56F83, ...) ;
- *Toolchain setup*: Initiative to integrate toolchains on the CMake + Docker
  suite, aiming to encourage, for example, the use of pipelines to adopt CI/CD
  practices.
- *Automated test benches design*: design of automated test benches under linux to validate
  ongoing developments, putting effort on automating tests using simple specification formalisms
  like [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/) or [Robot framework](https://robotframework.org/).
  I occasionally contribute to the [Panduza](https://github.com/panduza) project to this end.
- *Technical expertise*: Writing of public and private technical content on the company's internal wiki at national level, creation of reusable repositories (github).

## Internship: Conception of a PCIe *endpoint* driver for linux - ELSYS Design

**03/2021 - 09/2021**

This internship involved developing the drivers for a PCIe card implementing a 1 Hz - 100 MHz function generator,
based on a Xilinx MPSoC Zynq. Both the PCIe *endpoint* (board side), and PCIe *host* (host PC side) drivers have been
designed and developed, in order to drive the board. In addition, a web based graphical interfaces
controlled the overall system.


### Developed skills:

- *Linux driver development*: C on embedded target, under Xilinx environment (Vitis);
- *Integration* : Yocto / Petalinux integration, encapsulated in a Docker container;
- *Agile and V cycle method*: Regular deliveries versioned under git, regular meetings with the software dev. team to present the progress.


## Embedded software development - HyVibe

**10/2018 - 03/2021**

Worked as a freelancer during the development of the flagship product of [HyVibe](https://hyvibe.audio),
the H1 module used in [HyVibe guitars](https://hyvibeguitar.com).

- Engaged in the conception and development of an industrial-grade test bench,
  encompassing both software and hardware components, tailored for use during the manufacturing
  process of the products.
- Conducted comprehensive testing and seamless integration of diverse drivers in the course of
  prototyping the product's industrial version.
- Undertook proficient embedded systems development, focusing on stm32h7 microcontroller.
- Demonstrated expertise in the design and rapid prototyping of PCBs, exclusively utilized for
  internal purposes during the R&D phase.
